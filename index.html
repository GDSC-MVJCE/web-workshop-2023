    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      My main focus these days is <b>Tailwind </b> — an
      <i>open-source</i> utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom
      user interfaces. <br />
      I made the decision to work on it full-time beginning in 2019, and have a
      lot of plans for continuing to improve the framework, grow the community,
      and expand the ecosystem. Here are some of the other projects I've worked
      on in the past — some still actively maintained, and others retired or on
      pause.

    <h3>Projects portfolio</h3>
    <p>
      A Laravel development environment for Mac minimalists that just works.
      Taylor Otwell and I originally developed Valet over a few flurried nights
      in May 2016, and it's now maintained by my friends Chris Brown and Matt
      Stauffer.
